			<p>Our heroes met in the basement of an Ann Taylor Loft where comedians came to get drunk and occasionally tell jokes. Like most econ majors and law school graduates in 2011, these goofs were waiting tables. Between getting tipped in pocket change, cleaning up other people's vomit, and blacking out at Lucky Bar (ok, that one was just Chrissy), a love blossomed between these two humble servers.</p>

			<p>Brian had all the trappings of an elder millenial hipster that Chrissy found irresistable: an extensive vinyl collection, a fixie (<em>Brian, ETA: actually, it was a single speed</em>), and a job at NPR. Brian was able to overlook the fact that Chrissy lived in Woodley Park and went to hookah bars a lot because her wit and love for chicken wings was too irresistable to ignore.</p>

			<p>After a few months of dating in secret, these star-crossed lovers gave the Improv a big middle finger and broke out on their own. They hit some initial stumbling blocks, like when Chrissy took Brian to a poetry slam or when Brian gave himself giardia drinking a home brewed beer in Guatemala. But they made it through and by comparison the next few years were smooth sailing. That is until Chrissy moved to NYC in 2015 and we were all like "Oh no, what's gonna happen these two??????"</p>

			<p>But it all turned out fine bc Brian got a job with a moderately well-known crossword production company (that also makes a good daily podcast, apparently!). Chrissy decided she wanted to lock  that legacy media connect down and asked Brian to get married or whatever.</p>

			<p>A month later, Chrissy had to ask again because she wasn't sure he knew she was "like, within the next year" serious. Then she made a massive spreadsheet and not one BUT TWO wedding websites, one of which you're enjoying right now.</p>
